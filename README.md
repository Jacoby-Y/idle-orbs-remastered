## Idle Orbs: Remastered

Hello peeps. This is my attempt at remaking, and remastering, my very first Idle Orbs game.
I did this for two reasons:

- The original version sucked lol
- For an example of how I make 
[my games](https://jacoby-y.itch.io/)
and use
[my engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cobys-epic-engine)

Anyway, that's about it. Bye guys!

Also, I have this thing that I do where I make a game and never touch it ever again lol.
I mean... I'm literally *remastering* Idle Orbs instead of... ya know... updating the dang game.
So, will I keep updating this game? Well, I'm also working on Idle Orbs 4 as of writing this.
In which, I'm planning on rolling out updates for that game, so I probably won't touch this thing until further notice.

Ok, bye forever internet person.
